    "**Missing Completely at Random**\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.\n",

    "If values for observations are missing completely at random, then disregarding those cases would not bias the inferences made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing at Random**\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing as Random (MAR) occurs when there is a systematic relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data. In other words, the probability an observation being missing depends only on available information (other variables in the dataset), but not on the variable itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if men are more likely to disclose their weight than women, weight is MAR (on variable gender). The weight information will be missing at random for those men and women that decided not to disclose their weight, but as men are more prone to disclose it, there will be more missing values for women than for men.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a situation like the above, if we decide to proceed with the variable with missing values, we might benefit from including gender to control the bias in weight for the missing observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Not At Random - Depends on Unobserved Predictors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Missingness depends on information that has not been recorded, and this information also predicts the missing values. E.g., if a particular treatment causes discomfort, a patient is more likely to drop out of the study (and 'discomfort' is not measured).\n",

Take the example of revenue forecasting: if unusual spikes of revenue are observed, it's probably a good ide to pay extra attention to them and figure out what caused the spike.
