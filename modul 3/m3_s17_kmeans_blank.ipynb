    "Is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. **It tries to make the inter-cluster data points as similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different (far) as possible**. It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the cluster’s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. The less variation we have within clusters, the more homogeneous (similar) the data points are within the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize the algorithm as illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: directly after starting it, the initial centroids (cluster centers) are chosen. \n",
    "2. **Centroid assignment**: each sample in the dataset is assigned to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "3. **Centroid correction**: new centroids are created by computing new means for the assignments created in step 2.\n",
    "4. **Difference comparison**: for each centroid, the difference between old and new is compared, and the algorithm stops when the difference is lower than a threshold called inertia, or tolerance. Otherwise, it moves back to step 2."
